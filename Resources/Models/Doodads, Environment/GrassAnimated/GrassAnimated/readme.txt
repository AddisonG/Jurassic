GrassAnimated
By Sunchips

Description:
I got the inspiration from the animated grass found in the ultimate terraining map but wanted to make a version fitting my likings better. Tip: Tint the doodad in the world editor to get different colors (150 red 255 green 150 blue makes a good fores environment color)
