# Jass Naming Conventions

Since it's hard to be consistent, and I keep accidentally causing myself trouble
here is a style guide to conform to.

 - Structs/objects should be in UpperCamelCase
 - Functions should be lower_underscored
 - Variables should be lower_underscored
 - Global variables should be in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
