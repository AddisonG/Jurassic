# Jurassic
Jurassic is a mod for Warcraft 3, based on an earlier mod (https://www.epicwar.com/maps/218853/) by SaMmM & qwerty.

The goal of the game is for each player to ensure the survival of their single starting character, by fortifying themselves using their surroundings. They will have to stave off fierce raptors, rabid bats, and giant roaming beasts that walked the pre-historic lands.

There are four difficulty settings, which define:
 - Starting period of grace.
 - Duration to hold out for.
 - Progression of dinosaur breeds and ferocity.
 - The threat level of roaming dinosaurs.

There are four areas for survivors to specialise in:
 - Mechanic (Relocations & scouting)
 - Poacher (Mobile weapons & traps)
 - Engineer (Base defence & repairs)
 - Biologist (Taming & gathering)

Each quadrant of the map has different bonuses associated with it:
 - Rock Lands (North-East)
 - Frozen Lands (North-West)
 - Tropical Lands (South-West)
 - Swamp Lands (South-East)
